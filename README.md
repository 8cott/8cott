## Projects

### GPT Fitness

GPT Fitness allows user from the client side to input their physical stats, workout days per week, and dietary restrictions and submit a request to the gpt-3.5-turbo api from openai, which will send back a custom fitness and diet plan. Users who signup and login have the ability to save their plans and delete them. Whenever a logged in user clicks the submit button, their details are saved so they do not need to keep entering them again.

### Real Estate Listings App

The Real Estate Listings App is a Full Stack web application developed during my software development bootcamp at NYU. It was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and features a clean, simple, and responsive user interface designed with MUI and CSS. The app allows users to view, add, update, edit, and delete real estate listings.

### Closing Costs Calculator

This is a closing costs calculator for NYC real estate that I built to help me figure out closing costs for NYC real estate sales for buyers and sellers of condos, co-ops, and townhouses.
It is still a work in progress and closing costs cannot be calculated accurately until your attorney issues a closing statement, so it should not be used by the public to calculate closing costs.

### Quiz Game

The Quiz Game was my first milestone project for the Software Development Bootcamp at NYU. I created a quiz/trivia game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is responsive, and the website features a simple design with a black, purple, and grey color scheme.
