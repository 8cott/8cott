## Projects

### Real Estate Listings App

The Real Estate Listings App is a server-side rendered web application developed during my software development bootcamp at NYU. It was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and features a clean, simple, and responsive user interface designed with SCSS (Sass). The app allows users to view, add, update, edit, and delete real estate listings.

### Quiz Game

The Quiz Game was my first milestone project for the Software Development Bootcamp at NYU. I created a quiz/trivia game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The layout is responsive, and the website features a simple design with a black, purple, and grey color scheme.
